# Shiny-Like Python App

This is a simple Python app using the `shiny` library, which provides a Shiny-like syntax in Python for creating interactive web applications.

## Description

The application consists of a single-page interface with an input text box for entering a name and an output text area to display the entered name. The entered name is dynamically displayed on the page using the Shiny reactive paradigm.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the `shiny` library installed. If not, you can install it using:

```bash
pip install shiny
```



## Usage

- Clone this repository or copy the provided code into a Python script (e.g., app.py).
- Run the Python script:

```bash
git clone repo.url
shiny run app/sample.py
``` 
Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local URL (usually http://127.0.0.1:8050/).

Enter a name in the input text box, and the entered name will be dynamically displayed in the output text area.
